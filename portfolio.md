Here is a selection of my most notable projects, highlighting both individual and collaborative efforts. Although some of these projects are not publicly available on my GitHub repository due to confidentiality, I am pleased to provide an overview of my accomplishments.
### Comprehensive Intelligence Analysis and Target Monitoring Services
I have analyzed various targets and anti-state factors in multiple countries, as assigned by specific governmental clients, providing intelligence assistance on both domestic and international elements using the provided data. My work ensures privacy for those concerned about data leaks from online services. Additionally, I conduct in-depth analyses of individual targets, including personality and perception assessments across all social media platforms. This involves detailed examination of their comments and posts, complemented by visual representations and comprehensive reports. I also offer daily monitoring of targets as needed.
AI-Driven Propaganda Detection and Comprehensive Target Analysis
In my freelance role, I undertook an AI-driven project focused on detecting propaganda and identifying anti-state elements across various countries. This project involved conducting extensive and comprehensive analyses of multiple targets simultaneously, while also examining the interconnections between them. Utilizing advanced AI techniques, I created detailed visual representations to map these linkages effectively. Additionally, I conducted in-depth analyses of news articles on specific topics, identifying closely associated individuals and key contributors. This included a thorough examination of common link factors such as followers, commenters, and followings. The project also applied AI methodologies to case studies, enhancing the overall depth and accuracy of the analysis.
